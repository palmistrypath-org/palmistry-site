# AI Handoff - Palmistry Path

## Before working
1. Read `../AGENTS.md`.
2. If `ACTIVE_TASK.md` is active, read it next.
3. Read only the task-relevant portions of `PRODUCT_VISION.md`, `CURRENT_STATE.md`, recent/relevant `DECISIONS.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, and `ARCHITECTURE.md` as directed by the task.
4. For editorial work, open only relevant sections of the editorial guide/template and any directly relevant specialized planning doc.
5. Search/grep before opening large source/content files.
6. Inspect the actual relevant implementation/content and current Git state.

## Current continuation context
Current focus: none. `ACTIVE_TASK.md` is INACTIVE and awaiting the next assignment.

Latest completed implementation: on 2026-08-10 Remediation Batch 2B, Source Integrity & Editorial Trust, established the four-tier source policy in `editorial-style-guide.md` §5, added the permanent task startup/local sync rule to `AGENTS.md`, stripped all weak and encyclopaedia citations from the corpus, re-sourced the Chinese and Indian tradition articles, corrected the audit's flagged factual claims, fixed the highest-risk unverifiable quotations, and regenerated the About page source list.

A pre-merge correction pass on 2026-08-10 fixed a contradiction introduced by Batch 2B: the branch had established from the primary texts that Cheiro and Benham read the life line for length of life, then published content claiming the tradition never did. The rule that prevents a repeat is in `DECISIONS.md` and `editorial-style-guide.md` §5.2 — describe the historical claims accurately, state the site's own boundary separately, never sanitise the sources to match policy. Apply it to any future myth-correction, not just lifespan.

Primary unresolved risk: **78 author-attributed quotations across 29 files cannot be verified against Cheiro's and Benham's texts and still carry quotation marks.** The concentration is in the mount articles and mount lessons. `source-verification-log.md` has the file/line inventory and the method for reproducing the check. Treat this as needing an editorial rewrite pass — in several articles the attributed wording carries the surrounding prose, so removing quotation marks alone will not be enough. Do not resolve it by inventing page references or by substituting a different weak source.

Preceding implementation: on 2026-08-10 Remediation Batch 2A, Accessibility & UX Safety, added global skip navigation, shared focus-visible styling, main-content targets, focused text-contrast/opacity fixes, learner-facing alt text for Lines lesson Figures, larger practical lesson/header targets, accessible labels/status semantics for the Starter Guide and waitlist forms, a search browse fallback, `/learn` module-card headings, and a focused accessibility audit.

Known follow-up: after explicit approval during Batch 2A, `npm audit --omit=dev` completed and reported 4 production vulnerabilities: 1 low, 1 moderate, and 2 high. The remaining fix path is `npm audit fix --force`, which would install Astro 7.2.0 and sharp 0.35.3 as a breaking upgrade path. Do not force that migration without explicit approval.

Key current implementation facts are summarized in `CURRENT_STATE.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md`; verify source before relying on them for a change.

## Immediate next action
Await the user's next Palmistry Path objective. Start it from a clean context if possible (`/clear`), reconstructing from Git plus targeted canonical docs rather than chat history.
