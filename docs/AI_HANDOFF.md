# AI Handoff - Palmistry Path

## Before working
1. Read `../AGENTS.md`.
2. If `ACTIVE_TASK.md` is active, read it next.
3. Read only the task-relevant portions of `PRODUCT_VISION.md`, `CURRENT_STATE.md`, recent/relevant `DECISIONS.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, and `ARCHITECTURE.md` as directed by the task.
4. For editorial work, open only relevant sections of the editorial guide/template and any directly relevant specialized planning doc.
5. Search/grep before opening large source/content files.
6. Inspect the actual relevant implementation/content and current Git state.

## Current continuation context
Current focus: none. `ACTIVE_TASK.md` is INACTIVE and awaiting the next assignment.

Latest completed implementation: on 2026-08-11 Remediation Batch 2C, Quotation Integrity, closed the quotation backlog Batch 2B opened. Every quotation-marked passage in a paragraph naming Cheiro or Benham was re-inventoried from source and matched against the six public-domain scans: 245 spans, 162 of them genuine attributions, 55 already exact, 107 corrected, zero left unverified. Beyond wording, it corrected five attributions that carried claims the sources do not make, one wrong work (Cheiro on Mars is in *Language of the Hand*, not *Palmistry for All*), and one of Batch 2B's own replacement quotations, which turned out to come from a reader's letter printed in Cheiro's book rather than from Cheiro.

The rule worth carrying forward is in `DECISIONS.md` (2026-08-11): a quotation is verified only when the source is saying it about the feature the article attributes it to. Fourteen passages in this batch matched the corpus and were still wrong, mostly short phrases sitting under the wrong feature. Do not treat an exact string match as a check.

Preceding implementation: on 2026-08-10 Remediation Batch 2B, Source Integrity & Editorial Trust, established the four-tier source policy in `editorial-style-guide.md` §5, added the permanent task startup/local sync rule to `AGENTS.md`, stripped all weak and encyclopaedia citations from the corpus, re-sourced the Chinese and Indian tradition articles, corrected the audit's flagged factual claims, fixed the highest-risk unverifiable quotations, and regenerated the About page source list.

A pre-merge correction pass on 2026-08-10 fixed a contradiction introduced by Batch 2B: the branch had established from the primary texts that Cheiro and Benham read the life line for length of life, then published content claiming the tradition never did. The rule that prevents a repeat is in `DECISIONS.md` and `editorial-style-guide.md` §5.2 — describe the historical claims accurately, state the site's own boundary separately, never sanitise the sources to match policy. Apply it to any future myth-correction, not just lifespan.

Remaining sourcing risk: **20 quotations attributed to Gettings (1965), West (1998), and Fincham (2005) have never been verified**, because those editions are in copyright and could not be text-searched. They are untouched and flagged in `editorial-backlog.md`. There is nothing to do about them without the books; the open question is editorial — whether to keep quoting sources the site cannot check. Everything attributed to Cheiro or Benham is now verified.

Preceding implementation: on 2026-08-10 Remediation Batch 2A, Accessibility & UX Safety, added global skip navigation, shared focus-visible styling, main-content targets, focused text-contrast/opacity fixes, learner-facing alt text for Lines lesson Figures, larger practical lesson/header targets, accessible labels/status semantics for the Starter Guide and waitlist forms, a search browse fallback, `/learn` module-card headings, and a focused accessibility audit.

Known follow-up: after explicit approval during Batch 2A, `npm audit --omit=dev` completed and reported 4 production vulnerabilities: 1 low, 1 moderate, and 2 high. The remaining fix path is `npm audit fix --force`, which would install Astro 7.2.0 and sharp 0.35.3 as a breaking upgrade path. Do not force that migration without explicit approval.

Key current implementation facts are summarized in `CURRENT_STATE.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md`; verify source before relying on them for a change.

## Immediate next action
Await the user's next Palmistry Path objective. Start it from a clean context if possible (`/clear`), reconstructing from Git plus targeted canonical docs rather than chat history.
