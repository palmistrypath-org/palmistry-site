# Changelog - Palmistry Path

Meaningful project-state changes only; Git history remains the detailed implementation record.

## 2026-08-10 - Remediation Batch 1 trust and technical safety
- Put the Complete Reference into waitlist-only state and removed the dead paid checkout URL from user-facing flows.
- Preserved the Complete Reference PDF source outside public Astro routing so `/print/complete-reference/` is no longer emitted.
- Temporarily disabled AdSense by leaving the publisher ID empty.
- Added centralized sitemap/Pagefind/noindex policy for private and utility routes.
- Added a generated-output audit for private route exposure, sitemap/Pagefind exclusions, AdSense script emission, and the dead Gumroad checkout URL.
- Applied conservative dependency remediation with `npm audit fix`; remaining advisories require a breaking Astro/sharp upgrade path.

## 2026-08-09 - Agent operating-system migration
- Added shared `AGENTS.md` workflow with progressive disclosure, Git safety, risk-based validation, active-task memory, definition of done, and cross-agent review rules.
- Reworked `CLAUDE.md` around Opus/Sonnet/Haiku routing, Codex independent review, token discipline, and `/clear`/`/compact` boundaries while preserving the established article approval workflow.
- Replaced monolithic `PROJECT.md` startup behavior with a compatibility pointer.
- Added canonical wiki pages for product vision, current state, architecture, roadmap, decisions, ideas, handoff, and active task.
- Preserved existing specialized editorial, SEO, email, visual, launch, and worksheet documents as targeted references.
- Replaced the Astro starter README with a Palmistry Path-specific project README.

No runtime/site behavior was intentionally changed by this migration.
